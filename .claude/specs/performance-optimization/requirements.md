# Performance Optimization Requirements

## Overview

Address a significant performance slowdown in the React application where React render time is 0ms but other browser time is 350ms, indicating the bottleneck is likely in hooks, effects, DOM mutations, or third-party libraries.

## Performance Metrics Analysis

- **React component render time**: 0ms (not the bottleneck)
- **Other browser time**: 350ms (primary performance issue)
- **Pattern**: High render counts with few props/state/context changes

## User Stories

### 1. Performance Identification

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to identify the root cause of the 350ms performance bottleneck, so that I can target the correct optimization strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing performance data THEN the system SHALL identify whether the issue stems from:
   - Expensive hooks (useEffect/useLayoutEffect execution)
   - DOM mutations or CSS property changes
   - Third-party node_modules performance issues
   - Hook dependency comparison overhead
2. IF the issue is in node_modules THEN the system SHALL determine the specific library causing the slowdown
3. WHEN multiple components show high render counts THEN the system SHALL analyze their hook usage patterns

### 2. React Compiler Integration Confirmed

**User Story**: As a developer, I have React Compiler enabled for automatic optimization, so that I can focus on the real performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ CONFIRMED: React Compiler is installed and configured in vite.config.ts
2. ✅ CONFIRMED: Manual memoization is NOT needed for user components
3. ✅ CONFIRMED: Focus performance optimization on hooks, DOM operations, and third-party libraries

### 3. Hook Performance Optimization

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to optimize expensive hooks and effects, so that the 350ms bottleneck is reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useEffect/useLayoutEffect are identified as bottlenecks THEN the system SHALL optimize their execution
2. IF hook dependency arrays cause expensive comparisons THEN the system SHALL implement more efficient dependency strategies
3. WHEN hooks run unnecessarily THEN the system SHALL implement proper memoization or dependency optimization

### 4. Third-Party Library Performance

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to handle performance issues in node_modules, so that external dependencies don't degrade app performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF a node_module is identified as the bottleneck THEN the system SHALL implement one of:
   - Workaround strategy avoiding the slow module functionality
   - Code modifications that reduce node_module performance impact
   - Monkey patching for experimentation and verification
   - Library replacement evaluation (extreme case)
2. WHEN experimenting with node_module fixes THEN the system SHALL verify the fix addresses the actual problem

### 5. DOM and CSS Performance

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to eliminate expensive DOM mutations and CSS operations, so that browser rendering performance is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the 350ms bottleneck THEN the system SHALL check for:
   - Expensive CSS property mutations
   - Large-scale DOM element creation/removal
   - Layout thrashing from CSS changes
   - Forced reflows and repaints
2. IF DOM/CSS operations are the bottleneck THEN the system SHALL implement efficient alternatives

### 6. Performance Monitoring and Validation

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to validate performance improvements, so that I can confirm the optimization was successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing fixes THEN the system SHALL provide clear measurement instructions for the user
2. IF the fix is experimental THEN the system SHALL request React Scan formatted data for validation
3. WHEN receiving performance data THEN the system SHALL verify it correlates with the original performance issue
4. IF performance data doesn't match expected patterns THEN the system SHALL adjust the debugging approach

## Technical Constraints

- Must work with existing Pokemon Collection architecture
- Cannot break current functionality while optimizing
- Must follow SOLID principles and DRY patterns
- Performance fixes should be measurable and verifiable

## Edge Cases

- Performance issues may be interaction-specific
- Multiple performance bottlenecks may exist simultaneously
- Node_module issues may require experimental approaches
- React Compiler status affects optimization strategy

## Success Criteria

- Significant reduction in the 350ms "other time" bottleneck
- Preserved application functionality
- Clear performance measurement and validation process
- Sustainable performance optimization approach
