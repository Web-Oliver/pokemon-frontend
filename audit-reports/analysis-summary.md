# Frontend Analysis Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current frontend structure.

## Key Files Generated

- `src_inventory.csv` - Complete file inventory with metrics
- `dependency-graph.svg` - Visual dependency graph
- `circular-dependencies.txt` - Circular dependency issues
- `unused-dependencies.txt` - Unused npm dependencies
- `jscpd-report.json/html` - Code duplication analysis
- `eslint-report.json` - Code quality issues
- `complexity-report/` - Complexity analysis (HTML reports)
- `unused-exports.txt` - Unused TypeScript exports

## Next Steps

1. Open `src_inventory.csv` in Excel/Google Sheets
2. Add these columns for decision making:
    - `component_name` - Human readable name
    - `used_by` - Which pages/features use this
    - `duplication_found` - Link to jscpd findings
    - `deps_count` - How many files import this
    - `risk` - (low/medium/high) based on complexity + dependencies
    - `suggested_action` - (keep/merge/rewrite/delete)
    - `priority` - (1-5) for migration order

3. Review dependency graph to understand code relationships
4. Check circular dependencies for refactoring priorities
5. Use duplicate analysis to merge similar components
6. Plan migration starting with low-risk, high-benefit items

## Risk Assessment Criteria

**Low Risk**: Small files, few dependencies, good test coverage, recent commits
**Medium Risk**: Moderate complexity, some dependencies, mixed test coverage
**High Risk**: Large files, many dependencies, high complexity, low test coverage

Start migration with low-risk items first!

## Project Statistics

- **Total Files**: 0
- **Total Lines of Code**:
- **Analysis Date**: Sat Aug 9 19:02:36 CEST 2025

## Quick Wins to Look For

1. **Duplicate Components** - Check jscpd-report.html for merge candidates
2. **Unused Files** - Files with 0 imports (check dependency analysis)
3. **Large Files** - Files >200 lines (check src_inventory.csv)
4. **Complex Files** - High cyclomatic complexity (check complexity-report/)
5. **Circular Dependencies** - Break these first for cleaner architecture
