## ðŸ“Ž Notes

### Current State
- **Design System**: Context7 Premium with glass-morphism effects
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom premium components
- **Architecture**: React + TypeScript SPA with proper layered structure
- **Features**: Collection management, auctions, sales analytics, search functionality

### Key Observations
- All components use Tailwind CSS extensively
- Premium design system with consistent glass-morphism effects
- Complex hierarchical search functionality
- Comprehensive form handling with validation
- Modern responsive layouts with sidebar navigation
- Rich data visualization and analytics
- **Critical discovery**: Advanced animation utilities system (`animations.ts`) with Context7 Premium effects
- **Comprehensive testing**: 18+ test files covering all UI components and interactions
- **Build tooling**: TypeScript and Vite configuration files directly affecting UI compilation

### Phase 1 Scope
This is the **discovery phase** only. The checklist maps out all UI files that need attention during the modernization process. No design changes or refactoring should be applied yet.

### Next Steps
- Phase 2: Design system audit and enhancement plan
- Phase 3: Component-by-component modernization
- Phase 4: Performance optimization and accessibility improvements
- Phase 5: Testing and quality assurance

**Total UI Files**: 56+ files requiring modernization
**Complexity**: High (premium design system with advanced features)
**Priority**: Focus on core components and layouts first, then specialized features
