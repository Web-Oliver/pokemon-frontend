CLAUDE.md - Pokemon Collection Frontend Project ContextThis CLAUDE.md file provides essential context and instructions for the "Pokemon Collection Frontend" project, located at SAFESPACE/pokemon-collection-frontend. This frontend application is designed to interact with the "Pokemon Collection Backend" located at SAFESPACE/pokemon-collection-backend.The purpose of this document is to guide the AI assistant in understanding the project's structure, conventions, and development practices, ensuring consistent and effective code generation and assistance.1. Project OverviewPurpose: The Pokemon Collection Frontend is a comprehensive React.js SPA designed to manage a Pokemon card collection database. It provides intuitive UI for collection management, financial tracking, auction management, search & discovery, and various export functionalities.Location: SAFESPACE/pokemon-collection-frontendBackend Interaction: This frontend consumes a REST API provided by the "Pokemon Collection Backend" located at SAFESPACE/pokemon-collection-backend. All data persistence and complex business logic reside on the backend.2. Architectural Style & Technology StackArchitectural Style: Single-Page Application (SPA) with a layered service-oriented design.Key Technologies:Framework: React.js (TypeScript)Styling: Tailwind CSSState Management: Zustand (preferred) or React Context APICharting: RechartsForms: React Hook FormHTTP Client: AxiosIcons: Lucide-React3. Layered Architecture PrinciplesThe project strictly adheres to a layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns:Presentation Layer (src/components/, src/pages/): UI rendering, user input, displays data from Application layer.Application Layer (src/hooks/): Orchestrates UI interactions, manages component state, handles side-effects (e.g., API calls), coordinates domain logic. Depends on Domain layer.Domain Layer (src/domain/): Core business logic, rules, and data models. Independent of UI/Infrastructure. Depends on Infrastructure layer.Infrastructure Layer (src/api/, src/utils/http/): Handles external concerns (API communication, data serialization). Provides data access to Domain layer.Cross-cutting Utilities (src/utils/): Shared functionalities like logging, error handling, formatting.4. Key Directories & Responsibilitiessrc/api/: API client modules for interacting with the backend.src/components/: Reusable UI components (common, forms, layouts, lists).src/hooks/: Custom React Hooks encapsulating application-specific logic.src/domain/: Core business logic, TypeScript models, services, and validators.src/utils/: Global utilities (constants, logger, error handler).src/pages/: Page-level components that compose UI elements and hooks.5. Testing Strategy (Crucial)No Mocking for API Interactions: All integration tests and End-to-End (E2E) tests MUST use the real backend API. The backend (SAFESPACE/pokemon-collection-backend) must be running for these tests.Unit Tests: Jest, React Testing Library for isolated functions, pure components, domain logic.Integration Tests: Jest, React Testing Library for interactions between layers (hooks with API clients, components with hooks). Real API calls are made here.End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Playwright for full user flows, interacting with both frontend and real backend.Performance Tests: Lighthouse, React Profiler.6. Git WorkflowBranching Strategy: Feature Branch Workflow.main: Production-ready code.develop: Integration branch for features.feature/<feature-name>: For new features (branched from develop).bugfix/<bug-description>: For bug fixes (from main or develop).Commit Guidelines:Format: Type(Scope): Subject (e.g., feat(collection-form): Implement smart search).Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore.Subject: Imperative, present tense (max 50 chars).Body (Optional): Context, "why" changes were made.Pull Request (PR) Process:Create PR from feature branch to develop.Detailed description required.Requires reviewer approval before merging.7. Important Considerations for AI AssistantContext Prioritization: When working on a specific feature, prioritize context from the relevant src/ subdirectory (e.g., if working in src/components/forms/, prioritize claude.md files or comments in that area).Real API Dependency: Remember that all integration and E2E tests are designed to hit the actual backend. Do not attempt to mock API responses in these test types.Tailwind CSS: Always use Tailwind CSS classes for styling unless explicitly stated otherwise for specific components.TypeScript Strictness: Adhere to strict TypeScript typing.Error Handling: Ensure robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms are implemented as defined in src/utils/errorHandler.ts.Incremental Progress: Focus on completing small, test-verified steps before moving to the next.
